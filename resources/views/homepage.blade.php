                Dev Giving is a project that aims to help open source developers raise money for charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dev Giving will provide developers with a small link to embed on their project readme, website, profile
                or anywhere they wish. If users of their open source project want to say thanks, they can click the link
                and donate some money to the developers charity of choice.
